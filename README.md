# Product Recommendation System  

This project implements a **machine learning-based product recommendation system** to provide personalized product suggestions to users based on their browsing and purchase history. The system uses **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering** techniques to analyze user behavior and generate relevant recommendations, enhancing the shopping experience and boosting sales for e-commerce businesses.  

## üìÅ Dataset  

The dataset used contains Amazon user ratings for electronic products. To ensure fairness, products and users are represented by unique identifiers rather than names or other potentially biased information.

## üöÄ Approach  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Rank-Based Product Recommendation**  
**Objective:**  
- Recommend the most popular products with the highest number of ratings.  
- Target new customers with trending items.  
- Address the **[Cold Start Problem](ColdStartProblem.md)** (when new users/items lack sufficient interaction data).  

**Output:**  
- Top 5 products with a minimum of 50 or 100 ratings/interactions.  

**Method:**  
1. Calculate the **average rating** for each product.  
2. Count the **total number of ratings** per product.  
3. Create a DataFrame sorted by average ratings.  
4. Define a function to retrieve the top *n* products with a specified minimum interaction threshold.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Similarity-Based Collaborative Filtering**  
**Objective:**  
- Provide **personalized recommendations** based on user behavior similarity.  

**Output:**  
- Top 5 products liked by similar users.  

**Method:**  
1. Convert `user_id` from object type to integer (0 to 1539) for easier processing.  
2. **Find similar users:**  
   - Compute **cosine similarity** between the target user and all others.  
   - Sort similarity scores and extract the most similar users.  
   - Exclude the original user and return the closest matches.  
3. **Generate recommendations:**  
   - Identify products interacted with by similar users but **not** by the target user.  
   - Return the top *n* recommended products.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Model-Based Collaborative Filtering (SVD)**  
**Objective:**  
- Provide **personalized recommendations** while handling data sparsity and scalability.  

**Output:**  
- Top 5 predicted product recommendations for a given user.  

**Method:**  
1. Convert the ratings matrix into a **Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)** format for efficiency.  
2. Apply **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to reduce dimensionality (50 latent features).  
3. Predict ratings by reconstructing the matrix using SVD components (`U`, `Œ£`, `V·µÄ`).  
4. **Recommendation Function:**  
   - Compare actual vs. predicted ratings.  
   - Filter out already-rated products.  
   - Sort by predicted ratings and return top suggestions.  
5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Compute **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** between actual and predicted ratings.  
   - (RMSE is obtained by setting `squared=False` in `mean_squared_error`).
